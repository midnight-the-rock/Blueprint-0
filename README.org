#+title: Blueprint-0: a C++ template
#+author: midnight-the-rock

Starting a new C++ project tends to be tedious because of setting the proper working environment, having a pre-made space to work with makes things way easier to get right into business. Hence, I made this template for that purpose. 

** How to use this template

After cloning this template, there are a total of three different directories you need to worry about: app, core, and build; the three are quite self-explanatory, within each you will find a premake5.lua file plus some C++ code as example code, you can get rid of it!

Before you remove the example code, be sure to test premake works by going to the build directory and running premake.

#+begin_src sh

  $ premake5 gmake
  $ make && ./bin/debug/Blueprint

#+end_src

** Have fun!

That is all, this template will be extended as much as I need in the future, probably some automation scripts. Hope you like it.
